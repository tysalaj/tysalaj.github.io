		<p> My name is Tyler Salaj and I am a die hard Green Bay Packers Fan. I am creating this website to help educate people about the history, the financials, the future, and a little sneak peak into some of the top players
			I am very excited to make the website and a lot of this information is solley based on my opinion. There will be some things that are on here from my research but almost everything will be my own opinion.</p>
