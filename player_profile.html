		<dl style = "position: absolute; top: 350px;left: 50px; width: 400px;">
			<dt style ="font-weight: bold;">College:</dt>
			<dd>Jordan Love attended Univesrity of Utah State. He attended this school for only 3 years and he declared for the NFL draft. He was a first round draft pick by the Green Bay Packers. This did not make a lot of people too happy.
			this is the case because the Packers already had a hall of fame quarterback and did not need to draft a QB in the first round.</dd>

			<dt style ="font-weight: bold;">First Four Years in the NFL:</dt>
			<dd>His NFL carrerr did not start how he anticapated. This is the case because he sat for his first 3 seasons. He played in a total of 2 games in those three years which is not a ideal start to a NFL carrer. His chance finally came in his 4th season when Aaron Rodgers requested a trade and the Packers moved on from the hall of fame QB to Jordan. 
			In his first chance as a starter he did ok. They started 2-1 and he had pretty decent stats and looked comfortable playing. The next 4 games were not good to Jordan. The packers lost 4 straight and Jordan looked as bad as it gets. Everyone including myself was already done giving him a chance. He ended up turning his season and the Packers season around and ended up making the playoffs after
			a 2-5 start. He not only looked better but he looked like a top 5 QB in the entire NFL during this time.</dd>

			<dt style ="font-weight: bold;">Jordans Personality:</dt>
			<dd>Jordan seems to have a very calm, cool, collected personality. He never seems to get ratteled even in the toughest situations. Every time he talks to the media he always has the highest praise for his teamates and is the ultimate team player.</dd>

		<h3 style ="position: absolute; top:325px; left:650px;">Jaire Alexander</h3>		
		<dl style = "position: absolute; top: 350px;left: 600px; width: 400px;">
			<dt style ="font-weight: bold;">College:</dt>
			<dd>Jaire Alexander attended the University of Louisville. He had a fantastic college carrer. He has many defensive records at Louisville for his fantasitc defensive performances. He ended up becoming the 18th pick in the 2018 NFL draft by the Green Bay Packers. This was a much needed position the Packers needed at the time. With the addition of Jaire it was a addition of a lock down corner on the outside. </dd>

			<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Wild NFL Carrer:</dt>
			<dd>Jaire starting his NFL carrer was just a fine corner. However, over the past 3 years he has become the lockdown corner that the Packers always wanted when they drafted him 18th overall in the first round. His stats are as followed: he has played in a total of 71 games and has 10 interceptions. This is a very good stat line. However, he does have zero picks sixes which is not a good thing. This last year was probably one of his worst. He was battling injuries and also he just seemed like he did not want to play for the packers.
			He did end up having a very good end of the year and a good postseason run because he had a interception in the playoffs which turned out to be very valuable.</dd>

			<dt style ="font-weight: bold;">Jaires Personality:</dt>
			<dd>Jaire has a very unique personality. All of his teamates have explained him as the wildcat. This is the case because he is kind of a wierd dude everyone is saying. An example of this is earlier this year in 2024, he ended up going out to the coin toss when he was not a captain. He did this totally on his own and he did it because he was from the area where the packers were playing the game. This has never happened before that I know of and it is a great example of how wierd and interesting Jaire is.</dd>

		<h3 style ="position: absolute; top:325px; left:1220px;">Kenny Clark</h3>	
		
		<dl style = "position: absolute; top: 350px;left: 1150px; width: 400px;">
			<dt style = "font-weight: bold;">College:</dt>
			<dd>Kenny went to UCLA and he was a first round draft pick by the Green Bay Packers. He was a very highly ranked defensive lineman coming out of college however he has done a lot more then anyone has ever thought he was going to do.</dd>

			<dt style ="font-weight: bold;">NFL Carrer:</dt>
			<dd>Kenny has had a great NFL carrer and has got a second contract with the packers. This is a big step for a lot of rookies and first round draft picks because if you are that good you will get a second contract with the team that drafted you causing your contract to be through the rough. Right now he is the second highest paid defensive end in the NFL. 
			He has a total of 34 sacks in 123 games which is very good for a interior defensive lineman. He has also created 7 fumbles which is a very high number of fumbles created. Overall he has had a fantastic start to his carreer.</dd>

			<dt style ="font-weight: bold;">Kennys Personality:</dt>
			<dd>From my research and watching videos about his teamates talking about him he has a great personality and seems like everyone likes him. He likes to give back to the community and was the packers nominee for walter payton man of the year which is one of the greatest achievements of someones charater in the NFL.Overall Kenny seams like a generally a nice human being and has lots of respect througout the league.</dd>
